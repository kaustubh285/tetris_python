# Encord Tetris Coding Challenge

This Python project provides a simple implementation logic of a Tetris game engine. The code allows you to simulate the decent of Tetris blocks in a grid and calculate the occupied height of the blocks.

## Features

- Initialized an empty grid of size 10x10.
- Supported Tetris block shapes -> "q," "z," "s," "t," "i," "l," and "j"
- Calculates the max height of Tetris blocks in the grid after every row.
- Completed rows vanishes from the grid.

## Usage

1. Clone the [https://github.com/kaustubh285/tetris_python](https://github.com/kaustubh285/tetris_python) repository.
2. Run the script with the following command `./tetris < input.txt > output.txt` .

The script gets the input data from the input.txt and prints out the occupied height which is written to the output.txt.
